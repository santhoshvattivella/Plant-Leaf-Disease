        INTRODUCTION :  <br> </h1> <hr>
        <h2>The most widely used method for plant disease detection is simply naked eye observation by experts through which identification and detection of plant diseases are done. For doing so, a large team of experts as well as continuous monitoring of experts is required, which costs very high when farms are large. At the same time, in some countries, farmers don't have proper facilities or even idea that they can contact to experts. Due to which consulting experts even cost high as well as timeconsuming too. In such a condition, the suggested technique proves to be beneficial in monitoring large fields of crops. And automatic detection of the diseases by just seeing the symptoms on the plant leaves makes it easier as well as cheaper. Plant disease identification by the visual way is a more laborious task and at the same time less accurate and can be done only in limited areas. Whereas if automatic detection technique is used it will take fewer efforts, less time and more accurately. In plants, some general diseases are bacterial, black spotted, and others are Rust, viral and Red cotton Leaf. Image processing is the technique which is used for measuring the affected area of disease, and to determine the difference in the color of the affected area [1]. Image segmentation is the process of separating or grouping an image into different parts. There are currently many different ways of performing image segmentation, ranging from the simple thresholding method to advanced color image segmentation methods. The segmentation process is based on various features found in the image. This might be color information, boundaries or segment of an image.</p></h2>

        <h2> Extensive research has been conducted to explore various methods for automated identification of plant diseases. The disease can manifest in various parts of the plant such as roots, stem, fruit or leaves. As stated before, this work concentrates, particularly on leaves.   Paper [2] discussed a methodology for recognition of plant diseases present on leaves and stem. The proposed work is composed of K-Means segmentation technique and the segmented images are classified using a neural network. They developed a method for detecting the visual signs of plant diseases by using the image processing algorithm. The accuracy of the algorithm was tested by comparing the images, which were segmented manually with those automatically segmented.   Paper [3] discussed various techniques to segment the diseased part of the plant. This paper also discussed some Feature extraction and classification techniques to extract the features of infected leaf and the classification of plant diseases. The use of ANN methods for classification of disease in plants such as self-organizing feature map, back propagation algorithm, SVMs, etc. can be efficiently used. From these methods, we can accurately identify and classify various plant diseases using image processing techniques.   In paper [4] an approach based on image processing is used for automated plant diseases classification based on leaf image processing the research work is concerned with the discrimination between diseased and healthy soybean leaves using SVM classifier. They have tested our algorithm over the database of 120 images taken directly from different farms using different mobile cameras. The SIFT algorithm enables to correctly recognize the plant species based on the leaf shape. The SVM classifier can help in recognizing normal and diseased soybean leaves with an average accuracy as high as 93.79%. The main aim of the proposed work is to provide inputs to an autonomous DSS which will provide necessary help to the farmers as and when required over the mobile. This system will provide help to the farmer with minimal efforts. The farmer only needs to capture the image of the plant leaf using a mobile camera and send it to the DSS, without any additional inputs.   In paper [5] the work represents groundnut leaf disease extraction and classification using color imagery. The color imaginary transform, color co-occurrence matrix, feature extraction will be done and get an efficiency </h2>
