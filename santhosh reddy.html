    <p>The major cause for the decrease in the quality and amount of agricultural productivity is plant diseases. Farmers encounter great difficulties in detecting and controlling plant diseases. Thus, it is of great importance to diagnose the plant diseases at early stages so that appropriate and timely action can be taken by the farmers to avoid further losses. The project focuses on the approach based on image processing for detection of diseases of plants. In this paper, we propose an Android application that helps farmers for identifying plant disease by uploading a leaf image to the system. The system has a set of algorithms which can identify the type of disease. Input image given by the user undergoes several processing steps to detect the disease and results are returned back to the user via android application. </p>
<p>The most widely used method for plant disease detection is simply naked eye observation by experts through which identification and detection of plant diseases are done. For doing so, a large team of experts as well as continuous monitoring of experts is required, which costs very high when farms are large. At the same time, in some countries, farmers don't have proper facilities or even idea that they can contact to experts. Due to which consulting experts even cost high as well as timeconsuming too. In such a condition, the suggested technique proves to be beneficial in monitoring large fields of crops. And automatic detection of the diseases by just seeing the symptoms on the plant leaves makes it easier as well as cheaper. Plant disease identification by the visual way is a more laborious task and at the same time less accurate and can be done only in limited areas. Whereas if automatic detection technique is used it will take fewer efforts, less time and more accurately. In plants, some general diseases are bacterial, black spotted, and others are Rust, viral and Red cotton Leaf. Image processing is the technique which is used for measuring the affected area of disease, and to determine the difference in the color of the affected area [1]. Image segmentation is the process of separating or grouping an image into different parts. There are currently many different ways of performing image segmentation, ranging from the simple thresholding method to advanced color image segmentation methods. The segmentation process is based on various features found in the image. This might be color information, boundaries or segment of an image.
